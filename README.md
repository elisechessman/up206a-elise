### About me

My name is Elise Chessman (she/hers), and I am a second year MURP student in the Environmental Analysis and Policy concentration. Broadly, I am interested in natural resource management, urban resiliency, water, and environmental equity. I was in Colorado living with family for the past year, and have also become very interested in just and sustainable planning for the mountain west region. 

## Goals for this course

I worked with ArcGIS throughout my undergraduate experience as a Geography major, but I am hoping to broaden my spatial thinking skills and become more comfortable using a spatial analysis framework to answer pressing questions in my research this year and in my work after this program. I also hope to learn more about spatial analysis outside of the world of ArcMap, so that I can use open source data and coding skills to feel prepared to answer spatial questions without having access to that very pricey software. Overall, I don't consider myself someone with great data analysis/quant skills, so hoping to improve on those and feel more confident as well! 

## Data Science Project Ideas

For my internship this past summer, I have been working with a non-profit in Colorado called Community Builders (https://communitybuilders.org/). The current project that I have been involved with is based in a very small town called Silverton, Colorado. They've been working with them to do values-based engagement, with the hope of incorporating these values into the master planning process. I have a rich dataset available to me that includes all of the survey responses, demographic information, and value themes and sub-themes tagged, but they unfortunately do not have any spatial component (aside from whether or not the person is a resident of the town proper or the county). 

While the dataset we have gathered may not be of use for this course, I am interested in the relationship to public land for the county, as well as some of the environmental concerns of the town being a former brownfield. Almost 86% of the county is made up of Federal lands. The town is also the site of [two brownfields] (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=96a117f6694942b1a3c8efdbe94122b7) , was formally a mining town, and has air quality concerns surrounding the continued use of wood burning stoves. Despite being perceived as a pristine natural environment by many of its residents and being surrounded by protected public lands, the town still faces environmental challenges.

Additionally, housing is a major concern, especially for members of the Latinx community that cannot find healthy, quality housing at an affordable rate, but they also don't have the same privileges in being able to speak up against this injustice.

I'm not sure how any of these can lead into a mapping project, but they are interesting pieces that have come up throughout the process of this project and I would like to explore them further!
