## Introduction and Research Question

###Question: 
What are the statewide trends that are occurring in Colorado? How are communities close to former mines or other extractive economies changing compared to urban areas and their surroundings?

For the summer of 2021, I interned at a non-profit based in Colorado called [Community Builders (CB)](https://communitybuilders.org/). Their mission is to “help local leaders build healthy, equitable, and prosperous communities to improve people’s lives today and ensure a sustainable tomorrow.” I worked primarily on a values-based engagement project based in the 600-person town of Silverton, Colorado. I mostly input survey responses and then tagged them based on the values from a list of major themes and sub-themes. Throughout this process, it became clear that some of the major issues that Silverton was encountering were not unique to this town alone. On a personal level, I learned that typing up hand-written surveys and manually tagging each response is a tedious process. Because the themes that arose felt relevant to other communities in the Mountain West, it seemed useful for other communities to be able to gather this information for themselves and assess it without needing someone to do that work for them. The team at CB and I discussed turning this process into a toolkit that guides communities through the engagement process and helps them to use these values in bigger picture vision/master plans. In Silverton, CB is staying on to work on the town’s master plan, so this will give me context for how these values that are identified in this process become a part of goals, visions, and plans. 

For this project, I hope to look at some of the trends that emerged in Silverton to see how they are impacting other communities across the state, and see what geographic, environmental, and economic forces are at play that push out and disadvantage certain groups. How does the geographic isolation and lack of economic diversity of former mining towns differ from the more economically diverse urban areas and the communities that surround them? By looking at brownfield data that identifies former mines and the towns around them and analyzing the current economic conditions and demographic changes of some of those towns, while looking to see if the more urbanized areas and towns around them might be more economically diverse and resilient to change.  

## Spatial Scope

I’ll start with looking at statewide trends by county that show shifts in demographics (using population size, race, and rent cost data from the American Community Survey). I then want to zoom in to some examples of former mining turned tourism economics and look at urban areas and their surroundings to compare how these demographic shifts differ based on former extractive economies and geographically isolated towns. I am specifically interested to see if Latinx and low-income residents are pushed out more from these small towns as they become increasingly reliant on tourism and second-home owners. I want to use American Community Survey data so that I can focus on trends within recent years (past 5, maybe 10?), and potentially see how Covid may have exacerbated these impacts.

## Data Sources

https://services3.arcgis.com/66aUo8zsujfVXRIT/arcgis/rest/services/CDPHE_Brownfield/FeatureServer
* This is a web service layer rather than a GeoJSON but does have helpful information on brownfields sites and their attributes and I’d like to find a way to use it.

Alternatively, this preliminary search for ‘mines’ in the “GeoLibraries” hosted by the University of Colorado Boulder has some useful data available for download as shapefiles regarding active and closed mines, federal mineral estate, material disposal sites, and others that I could use as my starting point instead (particularly the closed and active mines could be of interest):
* https://geo.colorado.edu/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=mines

For demographic information, I will likely use the American Community Survey for more frequent and recent data: 
* https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=0400000US08 

However, the Colorado State Demographer’s office also hosts a variety of useful data including:
* County and regional data 
* Housing, jobs by sector and labor force, projections for jobs and housing, and race that would all be useful to this analysis 
* https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/data/

## Scope: Analysis and Visualizations

One map will include the locations of former mine sites and the towns associated with them for the entire state, while a series of smaller maps that concentrate on specific towns and demonstrate demographics of importance. Additionally, some charts/tables will be useful in demonstrating the changes over time that I hope to examine, such as population growth, racial demographic changes, and economic diversity.


## Insights 

For my capstone, I hope that this analysis will be helpful in supporting the toolkit. I think that demonstrating the way that the Mountain West is transforming can help support the desire for communities to perform their own an assessment that focuses on shared values and assets that can help inform goals and master planning longterm. These spatial analyses and the potential challenges that they expose should be an important supplemental to piece to this qualitative planning approach. 

Bigger picture, it would be a goal of mine to turn this project into a piece of the toolkit, creating an app from a notebook that would allow people to interact with data and understand the trends happening in their unique communities. I am very inspired by a tool like [DistrictBuilder](https://www.districtbuilder.org/) and would love to learn to make this information interactive and accessible for people without mapping or policy backgrounds.
